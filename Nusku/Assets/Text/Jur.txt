JUR: Oh my, and you are...?
JUR: I was not expecting anyone here.

SEL:Sel

JUR:Oh right, I knew it. Hohoho

--

SEL:Aren't you an oracle?

JUR:Ohohohoho!! You are a clever one
SEL:...?
JUR:It's so lonely in here that it is nice to have guests once in a while
Did you come for a prediction too?

--

SEL:Not really

JUR:Oh, that's too bad. I would have done it for free.
Not that I charge, clearly.
SEL:You don't?
JUR:No, why would I charge for my little stories?
SEL:...?

--

SEL:Yes

JUR:What would you like to know?

--

SEL:About the tide

JUR:I'm sorry about it
SEL:What do you mean?

--

SEL:About you

JUR:I'm actually very nice, the other two are worse

--

JUR:Ohohohohoho!!
I'm too modest, am I not?

--

SEL: You are not

--

SEL:You are

JUR:Of course! I'm a delight
Although I can't move. Not like this anyway...
Why did he give me this body?Itâ€™s useless
SEL:He?
JUR:Ohohohohoho!! 
Never mind my blabbering. I have no one to talk to, so I am used to thinking out loud
So if it's not a prediction, what do you want?
SEL:A way out of here
JUR:I'm afraid that is not possible. I know exactly what you will do if I let you go
He doesn't need to be saved

Oh my, and you are...? I was not expecting anyone here.

Sel

Oh right, I knew it. Hohohoho! And I sure was prepared for that nice offering you brought! Hohohohoho!....hoho.

--

Aren't you an oracle?

Ohohohoho!! You are a clever one.
...?
It's so lonely in here that it is nice to have guests once in a while. Much nicer are the ones that bring fish!
Did you come for a prediction too?

--

Not really

Oh, that's too bad. I would have done it for free.
Not that I charge, clearly. 
You don't?
No, why would I charge for my little stories?
...?

--

Yes

What would you like to know?

--

About the tide

I'm sorry about it.
What do you mean?

--

About you

I'm actually very nice, the other two are worse.

--

Ohohohohoho!!
I'm too modest, am I not?

--

You are not

--

You are

Of course! I'm a delight.
Although I can't move. Not like this anyway...
Why did he give me this body? Itâ€™s useless.
He?
Ohohohohoho!! 
Never mind my blabbering.
I have no one to talk to, so I am used to thinking out loud.
So if it's not a prediction, what do you want?
A way out of here.
I'm afraid that is not possible. I know exactly what you will do if I let you go.
He doesn't need to be saved.

Give up, now!

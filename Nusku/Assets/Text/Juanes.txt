Hello wanderer, did you come for a prediction too?
The oracle lives in the deepest part of this cave. I came here to know if I’m going to make it big someday. 
I’m playing this song as my offering, what did you bring?

(Si uno no tiene el pez):

I’ve heard she loves fish.
Three should be enough.
Good luck.

(Si uno si tiene el pez):

Oh good! Fish is always a good choice.
Good luck.

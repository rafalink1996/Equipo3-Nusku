(Antes de tener la caña de pescar)
Oh, you want to buy something? Sorry, no fish. 
Can’t go fishing with that THING in the lake
...
You haven´t heard? There’s a huge monster deep underwater
Some people say it is made of light, and if you look at it directly, you become blind.
Only that crazy man has seen it and survived…
Not that it scares me… no … I can’t fish because… uhh…
I… lost my fishing rod! Yeah… that’s it

(Después de tener la caña de pescar)
Ohhhh, you got a fishing rod… yayy… 
...
Now you can go fishing!
...
Lucky you!
...
Best of luck!

There’s so much trouble
We really need a change. The mayor clearly doesn´t know what he’s doing
Maybe I should ask the oracle how we could replace him…
-----

Aye should be the mayor ‘ere. Terrible one, aye tell ye
Wachout for eel! May bite and lie
Ye wouldn’t believe what me eye ‘as seen
Defeat all three or ye’ll get sunburnt

Can you spare something to eat or see?
Botones: 1:Give bottle of light / 2:Keep talking
Outcomes:
1:
May the sun bless you, child. Thank you, from both of us.
Thank you for the light, it will help my dad see better. 
2: 
Oh, don’t worry, that’s ok.

Hey kid! you shouldn't be here!
Ohhh, so you got your eyes on the prize, huh? Tell you what. Beat me and the rod is yours!

(cuando uno pierde)
What’s the matter? Not so tough anymore?

(cuando uno gana)
Damn kid, you've got skills! Just hope you don’t catch the monster when you’re fishing.
Rumor has it that “big blue” controls the weather. Get it out of the water and everything freezes
Not that it isn’t already freezing…
You got a fishing rod!
---------
Do you want to play?

It is locked.

No one bought light bottles. I complained to the mayor. But he does nothing!
And there was a train wreck, so I can’t return to my home.

I don’t see a future to this cause.
They promised to show me some progress and it’s been eight months.

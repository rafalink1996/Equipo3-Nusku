Medri: Can’t go fishing with that THING in the pond
Sel: ?
Medri: You haven´t heard? There’s a huge monster deep underwater
Medri: Some people say it is made of light, and if you look at it directly, you become blind.
Medri: Only that crazy man has seen it and survived…
Medri: Not that it scares me… no … I can’t fish because… uhh…
Medri: I… lost my fishing rod! Yeah… that’s it

Rox: What’s the matter? Not so tough anymore?

(cuando uno gana)
Rox: Damn kid, you've got skills! Just hope you don’t catch the monster when you’re fishing.
